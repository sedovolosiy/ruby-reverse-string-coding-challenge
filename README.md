# üß† Ruby Coding Challenge

Let‚Äôs put your Ruby skills to the test!

Write a method that takes a string, reverses it manually, and returns the result. Don‚Äôt use built-in methods like `String#reverse` or `String#reverse!`. You can use standard library methods like `String#length`.

### Example Method Signature

```ruby
def my_reverse(string)
  # your code here
end

puts my_reverse('abc') # => "cba"
```

### Challenge

‚ùì What would your implementation look like? Drop your solution in the comments and explain your approach. You don‚Äôt need to optimize it ‚Äî just show us your cleanest thinking!

Let‚Äôs see how creative and elegant your Ruby can be.

**Ready, set, reverse!**
